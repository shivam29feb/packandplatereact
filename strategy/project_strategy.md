# Pack and Plate Project Strategy

## Business Model

### Core Service
- Platform connecting mess owners (Members) with customers
- Members set their own meal prices (typically â‚¹70-120 per meal)
- Fixed menu structure with standard items (chapatis, bhaji, dal, chawal)
- Focus on dine-in experience at mess locations

### Revenue Streams
1. **Subscription Fees**
   - Members pay for platform access
   - Tiered subscription plans based on features
   - Commission on transactions (optional)

2. **Value Propositions**
   - **For Members**: Customer management, digital presence, operations tools
   - **For Customers**: Discover messes, view menus, manage meal plans
   - **For Admins**: Platform management, analytics, support

## Authentication Strategy

### User Types
- **System Admin**: Developer/administrator with full system access
  - Created by existing admins only
  - Has full access to all system features
  - Manages other admin accounts

- **Member/Subscriber**: Mess owners or business subscribers
  - Self-register through public signup
  - Manage their own mess/customer data
  - Limited system access

- **Customer**: End users of mess services
  - Created by members
  - Access limited to specific mess
  - Basic profile management

### Authentication Approach
- Single unified login component with role-based redirection
- User type and permissions stored in database
- Session management with JWT tokens
- No public admin registration - admin accounts are created by existing admins only

### Admin User Management
1. **Account Creation**
   - Only existing admins can create new admin accounts
   - Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
   - IP whitelisting for admin access

2. **Security Measures**
   - No public registration for admin accounts
   - Audit logging for all admin actions
   - Regular password rotation policies
   - Session timeout and inactivity logout

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Granular access controls
   - Activity monitoring

## Database Schema Strategy

### Users Table
- Common fields for all user types (id, username, email, password)
- Role/type field to distinguish between user types
- Type-specific fields in separate related tables

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure
- Atomic design pattern (molecules, organisms, pages)
- Shared components for common UI elements
- Role-specific components for different user dashboards

### Routing Strategy
- Public routes accessible to all
- Protected routes with role-based access control
- Nested routing for role-specific sections

## API Strategy

### Endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (login, logout, register)
- Role-specific API endpoints with proper authorization
- Shared endpoints with permission checking

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Platform
- Member management and profiles
- Menu management system
- Basic customer booking
- Subscription management

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Advanced analytics for members
- Inventory management
- Financial reporting

### Phase 3: Scaling
- Multi-location support
- Mobile apps
- Integration with payment gateways
- API access for third-party services

## Future Considerations
- Scalability for additional user types
- Advanced permission management
- Multi-tenancy for member/subscriber isolation
- Integration with food delivery platforms
- Loyalty programs and promotions
