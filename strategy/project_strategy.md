# Pack and Plate Project Strategy

## Authentication Strategy

### User Types
- **System Admin**: Developer/administrator with full system access
- **Member/Subscriber**: Mess owners or business subscribers who use the platform
- **Customer**: End users who are customers of the mess owners

### Authentication Approach
- Single unified login component with role-based redirection
- User type stored in database to determine access level and dashboard routing
- Session management to maintain authenticated state

## Database Schema Strategy

### Users Table
- Common fields for all user types (id, username, email, password)
- Role/type field to distinguish between user types
- Type-specific fields in separate related tables

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Structure
- Atomic design pattern (molecules, organisms, pages)
- Shared components for common UI elements
- Role-specific components for different user dashboards

### Routing Strategy
- Public routes accessible to all
- Protected routes with role-based access control
- Nested routing for role-specific sections

## API Strategy

### Endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (login, logout, register)
- Role-specific API endpoints with proper authorization
- Shared endpoints with permission checking

## Future Considerations
- Scalability for additional user types
- Permission management beyond basic role-based access
- Multi-tenancy for member/subscriber isolation
